        All the corridors of the school should lead to the canteen but unfortunately, it is in a corner of the school. It has a small window through which the canteen incharge supplies us snacks, tea and cold drink. Our principal has allowed a stall of ice cream in the canteen. There are two other counters for books, stationery and beverages. It is mostly the parents who visit the stationery counter. The students go there only under compulsion. Their most favourite spot is the ice cream corner. The students flock round it and buy the ice creams that are available in different flavours.

            <hr>
            <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize">Was established in 1978</h5>
            <p class="text-muted text-left">Today, December 5th, our church is celebrating Sunday school day, and it’s the perfect time to stop and reflect on the true importance of Sunday school/ in the lives of the children of our congregation,/ the future of our church. Whether we acknowledge it or not, today’s world can be a very dangerous place, with sin and bad influences surrounding us/ almost everywhere we go. In this world, Sunday school acts as a safe place where children can create strong ties and friendships/ with their peers/ and with Jesus Christ. Beyond this role, Sunday school has Five Key responsibilities that it fulfills in our children, and we’ll look at each of these responsibilities separately today.

The first and simplest task of Sunday school is/ to teach the Bible to our children. We learn about God’s love as we hear its stories and parables. When most people are asked, “What is the most important thing children learn in Sunday school?” the answer is often “the Bible.” In Sunday school, children develop a Christian understanding of the purposes of Scripture. Through these experiences with the Bible in Sunday school, they learn to recognize God’s call to them.

The second task of Sunday school is to help us accept God’s grace. Knowing facts from the Bible is not enough. In fact, many non-Christians know more about the Bible than some of us who are Christians. Therefore, knowledge of the Bible doesn’t create Christians. What impels a person to become a Christian is the belief that the words of the Bible are God’s message to us. It is the recognition that God’s love shown through Jesus Christ is real. It is the acceptance of God’s saving grace offered through Jesus Christ that enables one to become the person God created him or her to be.

Thirdly, Sunday school helps us grow in Christian faith. Christian faith becomes a reality when the lessons of the Bible and our personal experiences of God’s love inspire us to love God and to trust God’s guidance, as we make decisions about our lives each day. Christians want to learn more about Jesus’ teachings and discover the gifts of God that come through the Holy Spirit. Christians also want to turn their full attention to learning more about what it means to live as a person of faith. They aren’t satisfied simply knowing the Bible and believing in God; instead Christians want to grow in their understanding of God’s purposes. They want their relationship with God to grow deeper day by day and year by year.

The fourth responsibility that Sunday School holds is to guide our children to become mature members of a Christian community. Sunday school teaches us that the ability to grow in relationship to God is possible only in fellowship with other Christians. Although Christians value time alone in prayer and communion with God, we also welcome times to praise God and give thanks for God’s gracious love/ in worship and prayer with one another. Through the bond of Christian relationship that develops, Christians strengthen one another so that they are able to carry their experience of God’s presence and love/ into the activities of their everyday lives.</p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">My school has one of the best libraries in town. It consists of two large rooms on one side of school building. It has large windows and is thus airy and well lit. There are long, gleaming tables with chairs on all sides. Chairs have also been placed near the windows for comfortable reading.

In one room the books of general interest have been stocked, while the other contains newspapers, journals and reference and other text books. Our library contains nearly 10,000 books on every subject-literature, history, science, mathematics etc. are some of them. There are also novels, classics and encyclopedias etc. Our schools subscribes to some of the best newspapers, journals and magazines from all over the world.

                <p class="text-muted text-left">I read in a big school. Likewise, it has a big hall. It is also known as auditoruim. It has a second-proof system in it such that any voice or sound in it does not echo awfully.
                    
                It is situated in the main building in the centre of the school it has five doors and a number of windows. It is air-conditionedbut has electric fans also which are put to work if ever the AC system fails. They are also worked with a generator when there is an electric breakdown and the AC does not work.
                    
                There is vast dais at the end of the hall. The dais is quite high and there are stairs to climb it has a curtain for dramatic performances. There is also a lecture stand there for speakers. A mike is there which is put to use when necessary.

            <p>Today, Something unexpected happened in my life, Actually It was like a surprise for me, I was completely shocked when I got to know that I’ve won the first prize in my Inter School debate on environmental pollution. It was the second time when I participated in debate competition. At the time when I participated for the very first time so I didn’t secure any position in this competition, At that time I felt a little sad but I decided that I’d do more hard work and I will participate again and I guess that I took the right decision to participate again, Also I learnt that hard work always pays off because At my first participation, I was not concerned towards this competition but when I faced failure then It inspired me to do more hard work and because of that I have gotten this prize, My parents are very proud of me and they have gifted me a cycle for my achievement and now I have known that hard work is most important to achieve success.
